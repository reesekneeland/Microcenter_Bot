This is a bot to automatically join the microcenter waitlist.

Calling microcenter_waitlist_bot.py will start a discord bot that interacts with users through that interface,
where users can then type .joinwl <first name> <last name> <phone number> to add themselves to the list.

When not using the discord implementation, microcenter_wailist_bot_standalone.py can be called with those same arguments in the command line.
